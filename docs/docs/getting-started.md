# Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Innovtt/Innovt.Platform.git
   ```

2. **Explore the Packages**: Packages for AWS and .NET Core services can be integrated via GitHub Packages. This allows developers to add only the necessary components, optimizing project efficiency.

The project is actively maintained and encourages community contributions, making it an excellent resource for developers building AWS-integrated .NET Core applications.
